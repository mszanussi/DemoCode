# CSCI 3110 : Algorithms and Data Structures

This code comes from projects for the MTSU Computer Science Course CSCI 3110 I took in Fall 2016. 
The focus of the class was to learn important data structures pertinent to general kinds of programming and software design, including lists, stacks, queues, heaps, and trees. 
The course also covered topics in object-oriented design concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## OLA-1 (OMITTED)
This program implements a basic class for a student roster and uses the class to evaluate grades for a class of students using some input student data. This assignment demonstrates basic implementation of classes (review from prior course).

## OLA-2 (OMITTED)
This program implements a deck of cards as two separate classes : one class for individual cards and another for the deck of cards. This assignment demonstrates encapsulation of data in a situation with no inheritance.

## OLA-3
This program implements a lookup software for books and movies from an arbitrary data file listing the books and movies. This assignment demonstrates polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation in a situation with inheritance.

## OLA-4
This program implements various comparison-based sorting algorithms and tests their runtimes on random lists of integers of increasing size. Algorithms implemented include selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
This program also demonstrates some usage of templating in C++.

## OLA-5
This program implements an unbalanced binary search tree and performs some analytics on the complexity of the trees generated for the data found in the bst.txt file. 

## OLA-6
This program utilizes the C++ STL unordered map (hash table) data structure to create a dictionary of words for simple spell-checking.

## OLA-7
This program implements a class for graphs in C++, as well as some common graph-theoretical algorithms -- including Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and Prim's algorithm for minimally spanning forests.
